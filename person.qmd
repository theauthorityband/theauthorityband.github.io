##### Aldi

Aldi is a versatile guitarist known for blending advanced techniques with musical depth. With a foundation in classical guitar and a focus on modern rock and shred styles, he specialize in 8-finger tapping and melodic phrasing that bridges technical complexity with expressive playing. Influenced by pioneers like Eddie Van Halen and formally trained under [Daniele Gottardo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIDa_mtB74E).

##### Andi

A drummer. Hits drum like he hits people. In the face.

##### Arie

Lead vocal, also plays keyboard, guitar, and bass when Rully is busy.

##### Dhany

Plays everything you can imagine, but mostly guitar and keyboard.

##### Imed

Vocalist. The least talented in the band and just here for the vibe. He loves alt-rock songs, a bit of emo, and a big fan of L`arc~en~ciel. Check out his social media [@imedkrisna](https://www.x.com/imedkrisna) and his [smule account](https://www.smule.com/L_Med).

##### Rully

A bassist. Be careful. His play electrocutes.
